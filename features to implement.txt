we need you to incorporate a drip system of messages.

Track each user’s last message date and message number in the Google Sheet.

Send the first message to new users.

After a set delay (e.g., 3 days), send the next message in the sequence if no reply or update.

Repeat until all drip messages are sent or user responds.

Update the sheet after each message with the current message number and timestamp.

Skip users who have replied or completed the sequence.
